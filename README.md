# 🚀Spaceship Titanic Prediction

## Overview
This project focuses on the Kaggle competition "Spaceship Titanic," where the objective is to predict which passengers were transported to an alternate dimension based on various features provided in the dataset.

## Files Included
- spaceship_titanic_vscode.py: Python script developed using VS Code for data analysis and model building.
- submission.csv: CSV file containing the final predictions for the test dataset.

## Dataset
The dataset for this project can be downloaded from the official Kaggle competition page:

🔗 [Spaceship Titanic - Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/spaceship-titanic/data)

Please note that you will need a Kaggle account to access and download the data.

## Approach
1. *Data Exploration & Cleaning*: Analyzed and preprocessed the dataset to handle missing values and outliers.
2. *Feature Engineering*: Created new features to enhance model performance.
3. *Modeling*: Implemented machine learning models to predict the transport status of passengers.
4. *Evaluation*: Assessed model performance using appropriate metrics.

## Results
The final model's predictions are stored in submission.csv, ready for submission to the Kaggle competition.
